		<h1>Marsha P. Johnson</h1>

				<h2>Who was Marsha P. Johnson?</h2>
				<p>Marsha P. Johnson was an African-American gay man and drag artist from New Jersey, whose activism in the 1960s and 70s had a huge impact on the LGBTQ+ community.</p><br>
				<p>When questioned about gender, Johnson would refer to the “P.” initial in her name, saying “pay it no mind.”</p><br>
				<p>At this time, being gay was classified as a mental illness in the United States. Gay people were regularly threatened and beaten by police, and were shunned by many in society.</p><br>
				<p>Known as an outspoken advocate for gay rights, Johnson was one of the prominent figures in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. Johnson was a founding member of the Gay Liberation Front and co-founded the radical activist group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), alongside close friend Sylvia Rivera. Johnson was also a popular figure in New York City's gay and art scene, modeling for Andy Warhol, and performing onstage with the drag performance troupe Hot Peaches. From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.</p>

					<h2>Stonewall uprising</h2>
					<p>Johnson was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn, after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men. In June 1969, when Marsha was 23 years old, police raided a gay bar in New York called The Stonewall Inn. The police forced over 200 people out of the bar and onto the streets, and then used excessive violence against them. In 2019, the head of New York's Police Department apologised for their actions, saying, "the actions taken by the NYPD were wrong". On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.A month after the protests, the first openly gay march took place in New York - a pivotal moment for the gay and trans community everywhere.</p><br>
					<p>Johnson has been named, along with Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona, by a number of the Stonewall veterans as being "three individuals known to have been in the vanguard" of the pushback against the police at the uprising.</p><br>
					<p>The riots are widely considered a watershed event that transformed the gay liberation movement and the twentieth-century fight for LGBT rights in the United States.</p>

					<h2>Other Activism</h2>
					<p>Following the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front and was active in the GLF Drag Queen Caucus. On the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, on June 28, 1970, Johnson marched in the first Gay Pride rally, then called the Christopher Street Liberation Day. One of Johnson's most notable direct actions occurred in August 1970, staging a sit-in protest at Weinstein Hall at New York University alongside fellow GLF members after administrators canceled a dance when they found out was sponsored by gay organizations.</p><br>
					<p>In the 1980s Johnson continued to play an active part in street activism as a respected organizer and marshal with ACT UP.</p>

					<h3>STAR House</h3>
					<p>Even though the Stonewall riots kick-started this wave of support for the LGBTQ+ community, there was still a lot of discrimination against them. It was common for young gay and trans people to be kicked out of their family homes by their parents. Marsha and good friend Sylvia Rivera, who was also an activist , founded STAR - Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries - an organisation to support gay and trans individuals who had been left homeless.</p><br>
					<p>With Rivera, Johnson established the STAR House, a shelter for gay and trans street kids in 1972, and paid the rent for it with money they made themselves as sex workers.[50] While the House was not focused on performance, Johnson was a "drag mother" of STAR House, in the longstanding tradition of chosen family in the Black and Latino LGBT community. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for the young drag queens, trans women, gender nonconformists and other gay street kids living on the Christopher Street docks or in their house on the Lower East Side of New York.</p><br>
					<p>Johnson and Rivera recognized that many transgender people turned to sex work after being rejected by their families, and they faced additional hardships and dangers through being unsheltered. Johnson and Rivera opened the first LGBTQ+ (Lesbian Gay Transgender Bisexual Queer) youth shelter in North America, and these trailblazers became the first Trans women of color to lead an organization in the United States.</p>

					<h2>Death</h2>
					<p>Marsha went missing in 1992 and shortly after the 1992 pride parade, Johnson's body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. They said nobody else had been responsible for the death. But many friends argued this ruling at the time, saying attacks on gay and trans people were common. Others said they saw Marsha being harassed by a group of "thugs" a few days before they died. Twenty years later, in 2012, campaigner Mariah Lopez was successful in getting the New York police department to reopen Marsha's case as a possible murder. After the NYPD reopened the case, the police reclassified Johnson's cause of death from "suicide" to undetermined.</p><br>
	
					<h2>Legacy</h2>
					<p>Marsha's legacy lives on today in organisations such as the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, which says it "protects and defends the human rights of BLACK transgender people". In February 2020, the Mayor of New York renamed the East River State Park in Brooklyn, The Marsha P. Johnson State Park and announced there will be a statue created in honour of Marsha, to be unveiled in 2021.</p>
