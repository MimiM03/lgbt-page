				<h2>What does ally mean?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A person who has a genuine, strong concern for the well-being of LGBT people.</li>
					<li>A person who supports and accepts LGBT people, and advocates for equal rights and fair treatment.</li>
					<li>A person who confronts challenges that LGBT people experience.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Who is an ally?</h2>
				<ul style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
					<li><strong>Allies are the people who want to learn.</strong> Allies are those who recognize they don’t know all that can be known about LGBTQ+ issues or about all the experiences of people who are LGBTQ+, but they want to understand more.</li>
					<li><strong>Allies address their barriers.</strong> They may have to grapple with some roadblocks to being openly and actively supportive of people who are LGBTQ+, and they’re willing to take on the challenge.</li>
					<li><strong>Allies are people who know that support comes in many forms.</strong> It can mean something super-public (think covering yourself in rainbow glitter and heading to a Pride celebration with a sign reading, “PROUD ALLY”*). But it can also mean expressing support in more personal ways through the language we use, conversations we choose to have, and signals that we send. True allies know that all aspects of allyship are important, effective, and should be valued equally.</li>
					<li><strong>Allies are diverse.</strong> Allies are people who know that there’s no one way to be an ally, and that everyone gets to adopt the term in a different way.</li>

					<h3>Recognize your privilege and use it for good</h3>
					<p>It's difficult to understand the realities of discrimination without experiencing them first-hand.</p><br>
					<p>An example of privilege? Simply existing as a cisgender person—and not facing discrimination for your gender at work. One in four transgender people have lost a job due to bias, according to the <a href="https://transequality.org/">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, and more than three-fourths have experienced some form of workplace discrimination.</p><br>
					<p>That said, recognizing your advantages can lead to feelings of discomfort, anger, shame, or guilt. Try not to dwell on those feelings and instead channel that energy in a positive way. “Recognize that you’re not responsible for building the system. But you are responsible for what you do with that knowledge, how you move on from there, and what you do with your privilege,” says Brooklyn-based licensed therapist Amelia Yankey, LCSW, who works with members of the LGBTQ community suffering from trauma.</p>

					<h3>Get Educated</h3>
					<p>One of the best ways to demonstrate your interest in moving equality forward and in being an ally is to get—and keep getting—educated.</p><br>
					<p>Make the commitment right now to finding the answer when you don’t understand something. The leap between being someone who’s kind of interested in the issue and being someone who is an active ally is an enthusiasm to learn.</p><br>
					<p>If you don’t know the difference between sex and gender or current LGBT-related news and issues, educate yourself. Ask questions, do research, and don’t be afraid to be honest about what you don’t know.</p><br>
					<p>It's wise to brush up on the issues that currently affect various members of the LGBTQ community. But remember, it’s unfair to expect LGBTQ people to relive their trauma (a.k.a. someone's coming out experience) or validate their existence for your own understanding. Yankey's suggestion? “Do some research online and shift some of the emotional burden off of the people in your life who have another identity that you’re privileged in relation to.”</p><br>
					<p>It’s okay to ask questions, but gut-check yourself to ensure they're not offensive or cumbersome. If you’re having trouble understanding certain topics, like the importance of using gender pronouns, find resources that will help you navigate those concepts.</p>

					<h3>Speak Up</h3>
					<p>When you speak up as an ally, your courage speaks to them.</p><br>
					<p>Allies often have an opportunity to address situations that others feel they cannot. When you intervene, you’re educating people around you, and demonstrate that you are supportive of equality and inclusion for all. Your voice sends a powerful message that you’re advocating for your LGBTQ+ friends, family, classmates, and colleagues because you care about how these jokes and comments make people feel, regardless of intent. </p><br>
					<p>There are many reasons why people don’t speak up when they hear something offensive, like “that’s so gay.” It can be awkward, people don’t know what to say, or don’t want to make the situation worse. But, words can hurt. When you speak up, it educates others, lets them know their words are not acceptable, and may give others the courage to speak up as well. You can also change how people act in the future. This is powerful.</p><br>
					<p>The best way to encourage allyship is to simply start a conversation. If you hear or see something that's damaging towards the LGBTQ community, gently point out the problem and use it as a teachable moment.</p>

					<h3>Be Honest</h3>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Speak openly about family members, friends, and colleagues who are LGBT, if they are out and are comfortable with you discussing it with others. People often assume they will offend others or make them uncomfortable if they mention LGBT topics. Also, remember that occasional disagreement is normal and healthy!</p>
					<h3>Support Equality</h3>
					<p>Support policies at school, work, or other places that help protect LGBT people from discrimination. Even if the issues seem small, they can have a big impact on people’s lives. If you see or hear of an unfair rule or policy, talk to a peer or trusted adult about your concerns and what you can do to make a change.</p>

					<h3>Come Out As An Active Ally</h3>
					<p>Reaching a point where you believe that straight allies are important—and wanting to be one—is a huge deal, and we’d never minimize that accomplishment. However, while feeling like an ally and even identifying as one is good, starting to find ways (at your own pace) to express your allyship takes you from good to brilliant.</p><br>
					<p>Anyone can be an ally, regardless of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Be proud to support the LGBT community. Remember, being an ally can be joining an LGBT group — for example, Gay Straight Alliance (GSA), a student-run group — or as simple as showing your support online.</p><br>
					<p>To many people, it spoke to the challenge of ensuring that allies know that their support can’t be just something they feel. In other words, to make real and lasting culture change, straight allies are going to have to find ways to actively demonstrate support. They need to become great models for helping others see what allyship looks like and what it can accomplish. The number of places where an ally can express their support is limitless. Your workplace (maybe by joining your LGBTQ+ and ally employee network group), house of worship, school, civic organizations, with your family…all of these spaces offer opportunities to get a conversation started, or, for some, transform the way that those conversations—and the actions that come after—play out.</p>

		<p>Allies are important and welcome supporters of the LGBT community. They can be effective and powerful voices for LGBT equality, and can not only help LGBT people feel comfortable coming out, but also help others understand the importance of equality and fairness for all people.</p><br>
