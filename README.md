# lgbt-page
A page about lgbt including lgbt terms, events, the history of Marsha P. Johnson; also learn how to be an ally!

I made that website because I have friends who are part of that community and I can see from the front row their experinces. I beleive that making this page will help people understand more about the community as a whole and help them educate themselves on this matter. I hope that this could help people.
